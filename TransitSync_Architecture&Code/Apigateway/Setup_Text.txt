1)Make ApiGate just as shown in the image AwsViewofApigateway,
keep the end points as they are.

2)Create Lambda function and attach them to their respective Apigateway endPoint for example:-
DriverRouteSelect(endPoint)->ProcessRouteSelect(lambda)
copy the code of DriverRouteSelect_ProcessRouteSelect into 
ProcessRouteSelect(lambda)
[Note: EndPoint_LambdaFucntionName nomenclature is used just for understanding, of where to put which code.]

3)Setup redis Layer and neo4j layer in Lambda Layers. Fill up the redis and neo4j Credentials in all the codes.

4)Copy the ApiGateway endPoint and Paste in Your_ApiGateway_Url in
TransitSyncDriver and TransitSyncPassenger 

[Note:Lambda TimeOut Would possiblely be needed To be increased to 10 sec in lambda Configurations, especially for ProcessRouteSelect Lambda]
